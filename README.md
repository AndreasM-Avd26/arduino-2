Using Arduino and Vernier Sensors
========

Overview
--------

Vernier has always supported hands-on, do-it-yourself projects for students (or teachers). The availability of very inexpensive, easy-to-program microcomputers, like the Arduino, makes projects easy and affordable. We recently posted a guide to [Using Vernier sensors with Arduino][1]. It is a free guide to connecting, calibrating, writing programs, and doing fun projects with our sensors.

All sketches are developed by Vernier.
